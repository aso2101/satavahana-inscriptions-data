		  <p>This is an ivory seal, and according to 
		  <ref target="bibl:Sankalia1960">Sankalia (1960: 
		  202)</ref>: “the seal has a circular flat base and 
		  a flat and round hold. The diameter of the base on
		  which the letters and the various symbols are 
		  carved in the negative is 15mm. The whole base is 
		  divided into four compartments. The latter are bounded
		  by margins with a rope-like pattern. Short lines 
		  decorate the periphery. The four compartments bear
		  four symbols, some associated with Buddhism and some
		  found on coins. The left hand top compartment has a 
		  svastika with angular arms. The right hand top 
		  compartment has the triratna; the left hand bottom has
		  probably a pair of hooded serpents or might be
		  śrīvatsa, and the right hand bottom compartment has
		  a symbol representing the triangle-headed banner laid
		  horizontally.”</p>

	<p>The edition is based on <ref target="bibl:Sankalia1960">Sankalia (1960: 202–203)</ref>. I have identified Kṛṣṇa with the Sātavāhana king, as this seal was found in the same layer as early Sātavāhana coins at Nevasa, but note that there is no identifying information.</p>
