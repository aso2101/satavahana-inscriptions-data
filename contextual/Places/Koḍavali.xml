  <p>About two miles northwest of the village of Koḍavali, there is a range of hills, where a gravelly path leads to a mound locally known as <hi rend="italic">dhanam ḍibbā</hi>, “the treasure mound.” This appears to be the ruins of a Buddhist stūpa, with four rock cut wells on the south and west sides of the mound..</p>
