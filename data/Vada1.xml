		  <p>On a hexagonal <objectType>memorial pillar</objectType>, ‘not wellshaped and well dressed,’ and ‘tapering towards the top. The upper part of the stone measuring 2’5” in height is broken away diagonally, obviously due to an original flaw in the stone... The lower part of the stone measures about 8’3” in height above the platform on which the stone is set up in the museum. The bottom part of this stone is said to have been fashione dlike an ill-shaped baloon, measuring about 3’9” in width and 3’5” in height” (<bibl><ptr target="bibl:Sankaranarayanan1972"/></bibl>).</p>

		  <p>“The pillar bears writing mainly on one face. There are altogether sixteen lines out of which the first line alone is found on the broken upper part of the pillar. The fifteenth line is continued on the side to the proper left of the main writing. In the middle of the stone on the face in the proper right of the inscription there seems to be a <hi rend="italics">Śivaliṅga</hi> faintly carved in a panel.” (<bibl><ptr target="bibl:Sankaranarayanan1972"/></bibl>)</p>

	<p>Note that a few lines, viz. 1–3 and 16, are to be read from right to left, which is rarely the case in </p>
	<p>Sankaranarayanan speculates that the number of days specified in the inscription (10,082), which corresponds to 27 years and 227 days, refers to the time elapsed within a certain era, which he tentatively identifies as the Śaka era. If that is the case, the inscription could be securely dated to November 3, 105 CE. I (AO) think it is possible, however, that the number of days refers to the life of the deceased Somayaśas.</p>
